# plateCalc

How many plates per side of, say, a Barbell ❚█══█❚, to reach the target weight?

Values for Weight implements are hard-coded for now, I have a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/cptSwing/plateCalc/) running [this preview](https://8p4hq5-1234.csb.app/) though, so feel free to fork or edit values in-place there :) 

No PWA implementation as of now (though planned).
